## About The Project
<img src="images/home-page-image.png" alt="home-interface" width="800"/>
This project has been developed to do interface work with a CSS framework. It is a clone of Medium, which is a viral platform today, and a website where we can share our articles and blog posts.

## Built With

While developing this project, CSS and Bootstrap features were used in the interface design with which we can make very efficient and rapid developments. Most of the HTML elements in the design are styled with Bootstrap 4, and the necessary icons from the Font Awesome site are also used.
